    <p class="text" marge>Welcome to my Portfolio ! <br>
    My name is Selim Coulombel, I'm 34 and I live in the Lille area.<br>
    I'm currently undergoing professional retraining and have been following a course for adults at the AFPA in Roubaix since October 2023.
    Having grown up with computers and having a certain curiosity, I turned to web development and immediately appreciated the logic and 
    reasoning skills that web development requires.<br>

    <!--Parcours-->
    <div class="title">Personnal experience</div>
    <p class="text" marge>My career path began when I was 16 in 2005, during my schooling, with a part-time job as a room and kitchen clerk in 
    the hotel business at weekends. I then had the opportunity to work on a temporary basis as a tiler, turner/milling machine operator, 
    inventory clerk and labourer. <br>
    I also worked as a multi-skilled employee for the Quick fast-food chain, where I stayed for two and a half years in order to be able to 
    finance my training as a armored truck guard. <br>
    Having obtained my "Armed guard" professional qualification certificate, I embarked on an eleven-year career with Brink's where I started 
    as a guard before becoming a crew leader. <br>
    Following the pandemic and the changes it brought, I decided to leave my job to try my hand at entrepreneurship. It was a very rewarding 
    experience, both personally and professionally, and it lasted two years. Faced with the difficulty of earning a decent salary, I decided 
    to embark on a professional reorientation which led me to code this website. 
    </p>
    <!--Projets-->
    <div class="title">Projects</div>
    <p class="text" marge>Once I've got my DWWM qualification, I'd like to get a job as a full stack developer to gain experience on different 
    projects. I'd also like to take the Google Data Analyst certification to deepen my knowledge. As IT is constantly evolving, I think it's 
    important to continue training throughout your career.
