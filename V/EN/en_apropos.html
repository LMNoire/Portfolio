        Welcome to my Portfolio ! <br />
        My name is Selim Coulombel, I'm 35 and I live in the Lille area.<br />
        I'm currently undergoing professional retraining and have been following
        a course for adults at the AFPA in Roubaix since October 2023. Having
        grown up with computers and having a certain curiosity, I turned to web
        development and immediately enjoyed the logic and reasoning skills
        that development requires.<br />
      </p>
      <!--Parcours-->
      <div class="title">Personnal experience</div>
      <p class="text" marge>
        My career path began when I was 16 in 2005, during my schooling, with a
        part-time job as a room and kitchen clerk in the hotel business at
        weekends. I then had the opportunity to work on a temporary basis as a
        tiler, turner/milling machine operator, inventory clerk and labourer.
        <br />
        I also worked as a multi-skilled employee for the Quick fast-food chain,
        where I stayed for two and a half years in order to be able to finance
        my training as a armored truck guard. <br />
        Having obtained my "Armed guard" professional qualification certificate,
        I embarked on an eleven-year career with Brink's where I started as a
        guard before becoming a crew leader. <br />
        Following the pandemic and the changes it brought, I decided to leave my
        job to try my hand at entrepreneurship. It was a very rewarding
        experience, both personally and professionally, and it lasted two years.
        Faced with the difficulty of earning a decent salary, I decided to
        embark on a professional reorientation which led me to code this
        website.
      </p>
      <!--Projets-->
      <div class="title">Projects</div>
      <p class="text" marge>
        Once I've got my DWWM qualification, I'd like to get a job as a full
        stack developer to gain experience on different projects. I'd also like
        to take the Google Data Analyst certification to deepen my knowledge. As
        IT is constantly evolving, I think it's important to continue training
        throughout your career.
